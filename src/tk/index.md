title: Star Wars Armor and Props

I've wanted to join the [501st Legion][501st] for a very long time. I first learned
about the legion back in middle school in the early 2000's and couldn't wait
until I could build a set of Stormtrooper armor and be one of the members of
Vader's Fist. That mission was set aside until I graduated from college and
started working full time, when I found myself looking for a new hobby.

I've built these pages to archive and share my progress, so that future
troopers can learn from the work and research that I've done. I also need to
mention and thank the [First Imperial Stormtrooper Detachment][fisd], an
amazing group of talented hobbyists and troopers who have been gracious enough
the share their experience and insight and helped me realize that I could
actually make this project happen.
