The big targets for this round of work were the folding stock and the magazine
housing. Finishing the folding stock was relatively simple, and I removed the
entire rod so that a 1/2" dowel can fit through the entire length.

I also worked on the front sight, grinding out some of the extra resin on the
sides, and fitting a guide in the center. While not the most accurate result, I
found a small flat head screwdriver that fits nicely in the sight piece.

The extra space in the center will be filled later.

The most interesting bit of work was the magazine housing. First, I replaced
the resin set screw with a real one.

[FISD member gazmosis][gazmosis_mag] makes resin magazines that look a thousand times better
than the one that comes from the Doopydoo's kit, but I need to make a few
modifications to make it fit.

The kit includes a much smaller magazine, so the sides of the mag housing are
very thick. To get the new magazine to fit, I either needed to make it shorter
and only remove a little material from the housing, or keep the mag intact and
hollow the housing out to make room. I'd like the mag to actually look like it
was inserted into the blaster, so I decided to use a [technique from another
FISD member][forum_grinding] that allows me to move the housing while keeping
the Dremel in place. This way I can get the control that I need to make the
sides very thin.  Here's my setup:

The vacuum removes some of the resin bits while the Dremel stays in place. I
adjusted the number of cards in the deck to control the height of the cutting
bit. It took longer than I expected, but eventually I got the magazine to fit.

I attached the mag housing to the barrel using wood screws:

More progress! I like that my "loose pieces" bag is getting more and more
empty.
