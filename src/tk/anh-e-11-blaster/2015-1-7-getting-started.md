What good is a Stormtrooper without his blaster?
------------------------------------------------
The BlasTech E-11 is one of the most well-known props from the Star Wars
universe. Based on the [Sterling submachine gun][sterling], the E-11 is iconic
as the Stormtroopers' primary weapon throughout the original trilogy. While
finding original demilitarized Sterlings can be hard these days, great-looking
replicas can be built from PVC and metal pipes, toy blasters, or resin kits.

The 501st Legion [does not require blasters][weapons] in their costume
requirements, but who would take an unarmed Stormtrooper seriously? Blasters
are also required for the higher-level certifications in the [First Imperial
Stormtrooper Detachment][fisd] (FISD). The members of the FISD forums have
already built amazing replicas and thankfully have put together incredible
tutorials and suggestions for creating your own screen-accurate props and
armor, and have been my greatest resources and guide on this project.

My build is starting with a resin kit from [Doopydoo's
Collectibles][doopydoos]. The kit isn't perfect or complete, however, so
there's a bit of extra work involved in modifying the kit to look more
screen-accurate. Here's what comes in the kit:

Out of the box, the resin parts feel slick and powdery. Most resin makers use a
release agent to help free the cast parts from the mold, and unless it's washed
off before shipping, is still present on the parts when they arrive. I washed
all the parts in warm, soapy water, scrubbing detailed areas with a toothbrush,
then letting them air dry.


Starting the build
------------------
I started with drilling out the holes on the bottom of the blaster barrel.
These are covered by the folding stock when the blaster is assembled, but
they're just visible enough that I want it to look right.

This was a bit trickier than I expected, since there's a tiny bump in the
center of each of the spots to be drilled out. I ended up drilling a smaller
hole to get started in each one, then finished them out with a 7/16" bit to
bring them to the full width.

The foremost hole is actually 1/2" instead of 7/16", and has an extra notch for
the folding stock to lock into on the actual Sterling.

The folding stock has a bunch of these holes too, and I want to be able to
insert a wooden dowel to simulate that brace on a real folding stock. I drilled
out a couple holes, but quickly got ahead of myself and drilled with too much
force, too quickly:

So that's going to need to be glued back together. On the upside, I have more
room to get the Dremel into the stock to grind out the other bits, and adding
the dowel should give enough structure to keep it together when I'm finished. I
ground out the parts of the stock that would have the dowel running through it:

    one of these.</span>

I also realized that the drilling and grinding is really quite loud for a
weeknight, so time to put the project away till the weekend.
