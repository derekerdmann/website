title: Green Stuff and Steel
---

"Green Stuff" is an epoxy putty that's made of yellow and blue parts begin
to cure when mixed together. It's a popular compound for modeling and is
good for detailed shaping, and can be sanded and carved once it's fully
cured. I used Green Stuff to patch up air bubbles, holes from the trigger
and safety switch, the hole in the front sight, and other spots that needed
touch up work.

Scope Rail
----------
The scope rail is the mount point for the blaster's scope and shot counter,
and since it doesn't come in the DoopyDoo's kit, I had to make one on my
own. Thankfully, [Billhag of the FISD made a great
tutorial][scoperailtutorial] on making one from scratch. I used a 1/2" wide
and 1/16" thick steel bar, bent it, and cut it so can fit into the top hole
and rear sight. I don't have a vise handy, so I made one out of clamps.

I still need to smooth out the rougher edges of the scope rail.

Assembly
--------
Once I had the scope rail finished and I knew the right distance for the rear
sight, I glued it into place with E6000. I also glued on the guards around the
ejection port and front vent.
