Oops. After looking at another blaster build, I realized that I'd put the
mag on housing upside down and that it should be pointing toward the front
of the blaster. I unscrewed the mag housing, re-drilled the screw holes,
and reattached it:

I also added a bit more Green Stuff to fill out some gouges in the mag
housing and stock, as well as fill in the cracks from where I glued the
stock back together.
